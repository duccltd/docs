# Fetching promotables
Enlay uses a webhook to make a request to your API to fetch a users promotables. It is advised when users log in to use the same email or credentials which relates to
the respective publisher (e.g If your site uses discord to log in, then it's recommended the user uses discord as a means of logging into their advertisement portal).

Below is an example of the request that we send. This will be sent at advertisement creation time to fetch the viable promotables for that user. For this example, it will target a specific API path (this is configurable on the publisher dashboard).

## POST `https://yourapi.com/api/v1/enlay/products`

### Signature validation
No validation required as of yet. We will notify when this is added.

### Request body
