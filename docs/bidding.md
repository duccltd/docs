# Bidding models

This is when advertisements are displayed and how much advertisers are paying for them.

Currently we support our _Budget share_ model instead of more traditional models like _Cost Per Click_ (CPC).

## Budget share

With the budget share bidding model, impressions are distributed to each ad depending on how large their budgets are.

For example with the following advertisements:

- _Foo_ = $10/day
- _Bar_ = $90/day

_Foo_ will receive 10% of the impressions that day, whilst _Bar_ receives 90%.

This model ensures that advertisers get a fair share of the impressions, instead of 1 high budget advertisement getting all the traffic, whilst still giving larger advertisers a majority.

It also makes click/impression fraud near impossible as common methods like refreshing the page hundreds of times can't be targetted at a single advertisement and therefore the ratio is not affected.

## CPC/CPM/CPA/ROAS

We plan to add these models in the future depending on demand. Let us know if these models would help your business!
